Reflection:
I think what I struggled the most on the planning. I would create certain functions or variables and not use them later in the code, or call variables incorrectly. I forgot a few parameters without realizing which were relatoively easy thingsa to catch but could have been avoided with some planning. Really understanding how the procedural code worked was the easiest way to figure out what needed to be changed. I would advise anyone taking the class in the future to plan in advance.
